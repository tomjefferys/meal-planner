## Issues

The week view should start on a saturday, as I want to do the shopping at the weekend for the week ahead.  The ingredients view should also start on a saturday.

Should be able to select a date range for the ingredients view, in case we want to break shopping down into multiple trips, eg for the weekend and the week.

There should be a single rating for each family member for each meal.  We should be able to see what those ratings are.  This is helpful when meal planning to see who likes what.

There needs to be a way to import/export meal data in bulk, to provide a way to back this information up, and not have to rekey this in if the application is moved.

When the shopping list combines ingredients it should ignore case, and also attempt to ignore pluralisation.  Eg "onion" and "Onions" should be considered the same item.
